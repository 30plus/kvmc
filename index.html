	<h2 align="center">KVMC: QEMU-free KVM Client/Connector/Controller</h2>
	<p>QEMU is a full system emulator, and KVM is simply a CPU virtualization implementation.
	While replacing the CPU emulation part with KVM, we get the popular QEMU/KVM scheme.
	</p>
	<p>With the help of evolving exploration on device virtualization, the device emulation
	part of QEMU is mostly not a necessity, so do the whole QEMU codebase.</p>
	<p>One said that to fulfill a special task, writing from scratch took them several months,
	but another approach of customizing QEMU shows no clear hope of being ready. The relatively
	large codebase of QEMU is a heavy burden over device developers.</p>
	<p>A brand new toolstack that benifits from both KVM and developing device virtualization
	seems to be a better solution, from both deployment and development aspect.</p>
